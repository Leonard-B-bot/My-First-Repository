		<h2>My Favorite Book</h2>
		<p>My favorite book is simply called Juilous Ceaser, it is more of an analogy of his diary with notations by another author sharing his views on Julious Ceasar's experience as a ruler. The book explores many things such as his views of the poor, and how he sees hard work; in essence its a book about philosophy.</p>
